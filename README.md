# Stack

The stack type represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of generic items implemented using a linked list.
It supports the usual Push and Pop operations, along with methods for Peeking at the top item, getting the size of the stack and testing if the stack is empty.
The Push, Pop, Peek, Size, and IsEmpty operations all take constant time in the worst case.
